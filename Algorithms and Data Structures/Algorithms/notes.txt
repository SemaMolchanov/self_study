ALGORITHMS

Algorithm - a set of steps or instructions to complete the task.

Well-defined algorithm necessarily has:

1) Clearly defined problem statement, input and output
2) The steps in the algorithm need to be in a very specific order
3) The steps also need to be distinct and Ñˆndivisible
4) The algorithm should produce a result
5) The algorithm should complete in a finite amount of time


Big O - theorethical definition of the complexity of an algorithm as a function of the size.


Time complexity - the way of showing how fast the runtime of a function increases as the size of the input increases.

Time complexity can be written as a mathematical function.

To find big  O out of a function:
1) Find the fastest growing term
2) Take out the coefficient
